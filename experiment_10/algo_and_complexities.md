# Distinct Subsequences

## Problem
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

---

## Approach: Dynamic Programming

### Idea

We define:

`dp[i][j]` = number of ways to form the first `j` characters of `t` using the first `i` characters of `s`.

---

## Transition

- If characters match:
  
  dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]

- If characters do not match:
  
  dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

---

## Base Cases

- dp[i][0] = 1  
  (Empty string `t` can always be formed)

- dp[0][j] = 0  
  (Non-empty `t` cannot be formed from empty `s`)

---

## Optimized Space (1D DP)

Instead of a 2D table, we use a 1D array:

- Traverse `s` forward
- Traverse `t` backward

---

## Code (Python)

```python
def numDistinct(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(n, 0, -1):
            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
    
    return dp[n]
